##HIGH RISE
Where practice makes perfect.


## Inspiration
College students look to land an internship or even a job in order to improve their portfolio or resume. However, the most important thing we have to prepare for to land an internship or a job is the interview. The inspiration behind this idea was to provide a practicing platform for students trying to get familiar with the interview process.

## What it does
High-Rise is an Android application that is focused to help students practice for the job interview. Users are able to go through a series of questions that are commonly asked during the interview and have an option to review their attempts and listen to the interview that they recorded.

## How we built it
The front-end was implemented primarily in Java in IntelliJ Idea with the UI designed through Adobe XD. The back-end part of the app was taken care of using Firebase. With this, all the recordings and user data are stored and saved in the Firebase database.

## Challenges we ran into
For all of us, this was the first time that we participated in a hackathon. Only one of us had experience developing an Android app, so we were learning as we progressed throughout the project. Especially towards the last minute, we had an error with our Firebase which we had to focus all of our attention to.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was the first real project that we worked on as a team, and so successfully developing software within this deadline was a victory in our eyes. Within this short time span, we had to learn concepts that we had no experience in and we grew familiar with making a project in this environment.

## What we learned
We learned how big of an impact a leader makes in a team environment. Under strong guidance, we were able to carry out our project in a well thought out plan. We learned about how to manage a backend server using Firebase, and we also gained some UI/UX skills. We were able to take the skills that we learned in the classroom, and apply them to our project.

## What's next for High-Rise
Developing a social network where people can comment and give advice on other people's shared attempts.
Upgrading from audio-recorded simulations to video-recorded simulations
Adding questions that are specific to a student's field of study
Expanding the number of questions and adding advice/tips to each question
